COGNCUR USER GUIDE

1. Quick start guide
- obtaining the font (links)
- installing the font (screenshot)
- quick MS Word setup
- what's in this guide

2. Feature guide / What is possible
- 'typeface features' aka what it looks like
  - loops: 
    - b, l, h, k have tall loops. 
    - d and p do not have loops; the stick length can be changed
    - g, j, y have low loops
    - f and q have a forward loop, but variants without a loop are available
    - z does not have a loop. I don't see the point.
    - loops have the same length as the middle zone
  - (no) pencil lifts
    - t, r, s, f: different from print letters + alternative versions
    - but x does have a pencil lift
  - slant: 3 options
  - arches: branching out, branching in (n, m, r, h, k, b, p / u, w, a, d, g, q ). Also: the 'small' letters are taller than they are wide.
  - teardrop counters: a, d, g / b, p
  - ellipses: o, c, e (s)
  - joins from the baseline
    - tight curves
    - straight, diagonal segment
    - letter spacing trumps parallellism
    - reasons: 
      - tight curves can't be confused with the wider arches found within letters (give example of letter/join confusion in Zaner-Bloser)
      - tight curves help achieve fairly narrow and even spacing (give example of uneven spacing in D'Nealian)
      - straight, diagonal segments don't occur in letters (except z)
  - multilingual characters
  - accented characters for phonics / spelling
  - uppercase
    - differences between uppercase and lowercase: lowercase is more consistent, re-uses the same elements, has almost no pencil lifts. uppercase has more unique elements, has pencil lifts both within the letter and at the start of a (therefore fake) join
    - uppercase has a lot of variation between countries, and it's not possible to accommodate all that
    - print-like A/M/N, S, ...
  - numerals
    - default number are lining (all the same height) and proportional (not all the same width)
    - select 'tabular numbers' to make them all the same width. 
      - this will also make the following characters the same width as the numbers: +, -, =, _, currency symbols, <space>, /, \
      - this will also make the comma, period and colon zero-width
      - this setting should never be used in normal text as it will result in incorrect spacing around interpunction
    - select 'old style numbers' to make numbers vary in height ('hanging' numbers):
      - these numbers are intended for use in lowercase text, therefore they will have proportional width
      - this makes the following mathematical symbols smaller: division, multiplication
    - other mathematical symbols: division, multiplication
- font styles (i.e. different slants, edged versus monoline pen)
  - slants
  - monoline versus edged pen
- didactic features
  - entry strokes from the baseline
  - exit strokes (s, p, germandbls, print-like r)
  - fonts with integrated guidelines
    - do not justify
    - creating spaces with and without guidelines
  - creating guidelines with special characters
  - overlay fonts
- technical features
  - OpenType features / requirements
  - workarounds
- ??? appendix: letter variants (or will this be redundant?)

3. Application guide / How to do it
- worksheet generator (online)
- Microsoft Word
  - setting all the features
  - inserting accented characters ('e' may look like 'c')
  - flattening stylistic sets through fontsquirrel.com
  - ??? how to use integrated guides or overlay fonts
- LibreOffice
- Powerpoint
- Canva Pro
- Adobe Indesign
  - using overlay fonts
- Adobe Illustrator
- (maybe in the far future...  

4. Sharing and contributing
- License information
- Reporting application support and providing screenshots
  - finish checklist OpenType support
- How you can help
  - contribute to the Application Guide by providing corrections and/or screenshots
  - converting to Google Fonts build process
  - I'm not really ready to accept 'ready-made' contributions to the font files. Github unfortunately is not up to the job of comparing changes in the .sfd format.
- Feature requests 
  - provide as many reasons as you can other than 'imitating existing curriculum / material'. Describe how the new letter variant is easier to teach, more consistent with other letters, etc.
  - but if you are trying to match with existing material
    - provide a full alphabet (uppercase and lowercase) and a small sample of connected text, so that I can see for myself if Cogncur is a good match for your material
    - please name the material and describe how it can be obtained
    - if the requested feature is used in multiple (competing) curricula, please inform me about all of them
    - please describe how the material can be obtained, how many people use it, and what kind of community there is around the material (i.e. forums or other communities that share material based on Creative Commons licenses)
  - provide sufficient samples of the letter you want changed:
    - provide samples of connected text with the letter
      - at the beginning of the ord
      - in the middle of the word
      - at the end of the word
      - before and after the letter 'e'
      - after the letters 'o' and 'v'
    - provide the uppercase version of the same letter as well
