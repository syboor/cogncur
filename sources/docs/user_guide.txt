- installing the font (screenshot)
- quick MS Word setup
- what's in this guide

2. Feature guide / What is possible
- font styles (i.e. different slants, edged versus monoline pen)
  - slants
  - monoline versus edged pen
  - overlay fonts

  - comparison
    - from italic handwriting (popularized in the US by ...) Cogncur takes the basic body proportions (height/width ratio) and characteristic body shapes (arches and teardrop counters)
    - 
    - compared with traditional US cursive (Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian), Cogncur is a lot narrower, has distinctly 'straight' connections, avoids some obscure US-specific (and IMHO 'degenerative') uppercase forms
    -   Connected ('joined up') cursive was invented after printing, and all cursive traditions are therefore ultimately based on print. Cursive has always been pushed between on the one hand the desire for ease and speed, on the other hand the desire to show off skill and cultural heritage.
  
      
      From the italic handwriting tradition - popularized in the United States by Inga Dubay and Barbara Getty - Cogncur takes ideas about regularity, proportions, and the asymmetrical shapes of arches and counters.<br/>
      From the German school handwriting tradition, Cogncur takes the loops, the 'straight' joins, the print-like but still connected uppercase letters, and a <span class='letter'>t</span> which can be written without lifting the pencil.<br/>
      With its many optional letter variants that can be enabled through stylistic sets, Cogncur makes many concessions to traditions elsewhere, especially in the United States and the Netherlands.<br>

4. Sharing and contributing
- License information
- Reporting application support and providing screenshots
  - finish checklist OpenType support
- How you can help
  - contribute to the Application Guide by providing corrections and/or screenshots
  - converting to Google Fonts build process
  - I'm not really ready to accept 'ready-made' contributions to the font files. Github unfortunately is not up to the job of comparing changes in the .sfd format.
- Feature requests 
  - provide as many reasons as you can other than 'imitating existing curriculum / material'. Describe how the new letter variant is easier to teach, more consistent with other letters, etc.
  - but if you are trying to match with existing material
    - provide a full alphabet (uppercase and lowercase) and a small sample of connected text, so that I can see for myself if Cogncur is a good match for your material
    - please name the material and describe how it can be obtained
    - if the requested feature is used in multiple (competing) curricula, please inform me about all of them
    - please describe how the material can be obtained, how many people use it, and what kind of community there is around the material (i.e. forums or other communities that share material based on Creative Commons licenses)
  - provide sufficient samples of the letter you want changed:
    - provide samples of connected text with the letter
      - at the beginning of the ord
      - in the middle of the word
      - at the end of the word
      - before and after the letter 'e'
      - after the letters 'o' and 'v'
    - provide the uppercase version of the same letter as well
