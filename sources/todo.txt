*** IDEAS (nice to have)

entrystrokes = 2: extra option to not have entry strokes on i/u/w (web only, no room in stylistic sets)
- this would be nice for javascript based applications, but there is no room to accommodate this through stylistic sets anymore

WONT: uppercase U/W/Y with entry stroke??? This would be confusing, given that J uses a wavy, horizontal entry stroke. I feel that curved entry strokes should ONLY be used when lowercase letters also have a curved entry stroke.


*** IMPROVEMENTS
LATER: kerning between uppercase letters
  - TODO: why does it not work in Chromium (but works in Office)?
  - TODO: split up ceO into ceO and ceV (right now, everything is kerned for V)
  - same for ceB vs ceS, ceQ vs ceZ
  - kerning after (proportional) numbers, before interpunction

Javascript:
DONE: optimize javascript using a single loop for contextual alternates (a la schoolcursive_desktopconverter.js)


???: revisit 'branch out' points of N2, M2 and U
  

*** MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY
TODO: edged fonts
- create 'edged' fonts at all slants. Write up some disclaimer that edged fonts do not represent typical calligraphy practice.
- document edged fonts (download links etc.)

TODO: fonts with integrated guides

TODO: testpage.html
- make it complete (all letter variants)
- rename page and scripts to make clear this is javascript-based, not opentype based
- create another page testpage-opentype.html to showcase how to use opentype features
  
SVG shapes
- letter formation images
- step-by-step letter formation
- animations
- localize stylesheet for page size; use css variables


Stripes at beginning and end of word
- goal: to teach students to copy text at the exact same width as the original
- dilemma: we want these stripes 'vertical' at all three skew variants of the font. How???
- complete vertical stripes (covering the entire line)
  - this should be an overlay with *only* those stripes
  - this requires dedicated entry/exit strokes for all letters that overhang their exit stroke (like 'l')
    - although we could decide to limit this to lowercase for exit strokes?
    - letters without entry strokes: not supported...
  - easy for Cogncur Vertical
  - Congncur Regular/Cogncur Oblique: use a single point, which can be at any height, and indicates the 'maximum extent' of the letter. 
    Skew this point. Then use a script to expand this point into a vertical line.

*** DOCUMENTATION
  
TODO: 
- testing/documentation matrix: per feature: what it should look like, what a 'failure' looks like, questions to ask (does it work automatically?). Features: contextual alternates; kerning; stylistic sets; multilinguage support; 'ij' ligature
- how to 'flatten' stylistic sets for MS Word
