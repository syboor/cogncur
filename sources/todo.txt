*** IDEAS (nice to have)

entrystrokes = 2: extra option to not have entry strokes on i/u/w (web only, no room in stylistic sets)
- this would be nice for javascript based applications, but there is no room to accommodate this through stylistic sets anymore

WONT: uppercase U/W/Y with entry stroke??? This would be confusing, given that J uses a wavy, horizontal entry stroke. I feel that curved entry strokes should ONLY be used when lowercase letters also have a curved entry stroke.


*** IMPROVEMENTS
LATER: kerning between uppercase letters
  - TODO: why does it not work in Chromium (but works in Office)?
  - TODO: split up ceO into ceO and ceV (right now, everything is kerned for V)
  - same for ceB vs ceS, ceQ vs ceZ
  - kerning after (proportional) numbers, before interpunction

Javascript:
DONE: optimize javascript using a single loop for contextual alternates (a la schoolcursive_desktopconverter.js)


???: revisit 'branch out' points of N2, M2 and U
  

*** MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY
TODO: edged fonts
- create 'edged' fonts at all slants. Write up some disclaimer that edged fonts do not represent typical calligraphy practice.
- document edged fonts (download links etc.)

TODO: fonts with integrated guides

TODO: testpage.html
- make it complete (all letter variants)
- rename page and scripts to make clear this is javascript-based, not opentype based
- create another page testpage-opentype.html to showcase how to use opentype features
  

*** DOCUMENTATION
  
TODO: 
- testing/documentation matrix: per feature: what it should look like, what a 'failure' looks like, questions to ask (does it work automatically?). Features: contextual alternates; kerning; stylistic sets; multilinguage support; 'ij' ligature
- how to 'flatten' stylistic sets for MS Word
