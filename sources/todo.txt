Extend the joins towards a... (useful for webapps, no problem in desktop font)
  
Entrystrokes = 2: extra option to not have entry strokes on i/u/w (web only, no room in stylistic sets)

WONT: uppercase U/W/Y with entry stroke??? This would be confusing, given that J uses a wavy, horizontal entry stroke. I feel that curved entry strokes should ONLY be used when lowercase letters also have a curved entry stroke.

LATER: kerning between uppercase letters
  - TODO: why does it not work in Chromium (but works in Office)?
  - TODO: split up ceO into ceO and ceV (right now, everything is kerned for V)
  - same for ceB vs ceS, ceQ vs ceZ
  - kerning after (proportional) numbers, before interpunction

TODO: create 'edged' fonts at all slants. Write up some disclaimer that edged fonts do not represent typical calligraphy practice.
  
TODO: 
- testing/documentation matrix: per feature: what it should look like, what a 'failure' looks like, questions to ask (does it work automatically?). Features: contextual alternates; kerning; stylistic sets; multilinguage support; 'ij' ligature
- how to 'flatten' stylistic sets for MS Word
  
TODO: revisit merging points of N2, M2 and U.
  
TODO: Use symbols for lines??? (at least in the regular fonts...). Pick 3 symbols: fully lined, fully lined without bottom descender, baseline + midline, baseline only (standard | symbol). Broken pipe (|)???
  
TODO: test line dimension 
- make names in stylesheet match actual lineheight
- create sizing chart in documentation
  
TODO: javascript: do oobreve etc conversion
  
TODO: testpage.html
- make it complete (all letter variants)
- remove non-working stuff (arrows)
- rename page and scripts to make clear this is javascript-based, not opentype based
- create another page testpage-opentype.html to showcase how to use opentype features

TODO: numerals. Default numerals will be lining figures (vertical height) and proportional (horizontal width)
- variants: 
  - 1.var1 (no hook)
  - 2.var1 (no wave)
  - 3.var1 (straight top)
  - 4.var1 (open triangle), 4.var2 (rectangular, both sides equally long), 4.var3 (rectangular, left longer than right side)
  - 7.var1 (no wave), 7.var2 (no crossbar, wave), 7.var3 (no crossbar, no wave)
  - 8.var1 (Dutch 'offset' construction)
  - 9.var1 (teardrop with straight descender)
- tabular:
  - 1: copy to 1.tab, 1.var1.tab; then reduce width in the default versions
  - same for other numerals that might need less bearings?
  - interpunction: space, +, -, /, currency
  - ...
- oldstyle:
