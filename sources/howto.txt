CREATE ACCENTED CHARACTERS
Do not 'Build glyph' in slanted layers; the accents will not have the correct position over the characters.
 
Instead:
- select your accented characters
- switch to the Skeleton layer
- Element > Build Glyph
- Edit > Unlink references
- do the same for these layers: Extra, ExtraCall, StartDot (so for each layer: Build Glyph, Unlink references)
- run the 'derive-layers.py' script.
